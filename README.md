# calculator

This is a basic calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I learned

For the calculator to be capable of calculating the inputs, I had to find
a good way to store the operands, then use them according to the operator selected.
Upon researching a solution, I learned about constructor functions, "this", and classes.
